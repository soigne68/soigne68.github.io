It's true that life doesn’t always give you what you want, but it often gives you what you need. After 28 years in the education sector, wearing many hats — teacher, leader, mentor, facilitator, confidant — I now find myself in a space I never dared to imagine: a life just for me.</p><p data-start="787" data-end="1172">My journey as an educator began in the humble, sun-kissed town of Sri Ganganagar, Rajasthan. A young woman with dreams in her eyes and a chalk in her hand, I stepped into the world of teaching with more hope than experience. It was there, in the quiet corridors of a small school, that I first tasted the joy of shaping young minds. Those early years taught me resilience and strength.</p><p data-start="1174" data-end="1620">Destiny soon took me to Jodhpur, a city that blended tradition with opportunity. For 15 vibrant years, I thrived. I built not just a career but a legacy of learning. I still remember the gleam in the eyes of my students when they understood something new — those little victories meant the world to me. I gave all I had to that city: my heart, my ideas, my energy. And in return, it gave me confidence, recognition, and a community that loved me.</p><p data-start="1622" data-end="1720">But life is a river — it flows, it curves, and sometimes, it takes you back to where it all began.</p><p data-start="1722" data-end="2424">In 2011, I returned to Hisar, my hometown in Haryana. It wasn’t a retreat — it was a return with purpose. Life had its own plans, and I answered with duty and devotion. I embraced my responsibilities — as an educator, a single mother, and a daughter. I worked tirelessly, with little time to pause, carrying the weight of family expectations and financial realities. Hisar gave me years of learning and labor, but also moments of intense loneliness. Living without my children, who were building their futures elsewhere, left a hollow in my heart. I longed for their presence — for simple everyday joys like sharing a meal, a conversation, or just knowing they were nearby. That yearning never left me.</p><p data-start="2426" data-end="2481">I always believe that dreams when carried with patience, do come true.</p><p data-start="2426" data-end="2481"><strong>"कहते हैं अगर किसी चीज़ को दिल से चाहो...तो पूरी कायनात उसे तुमसे मिलाने की कोशिश में लग जाती है।"</strong></p><p data-start="2483" data-end="2755">And today, I live with my children — and it feels like "a waking dream wish fulfillment". No more counting the days to see them, no more waiting for visits. They are here, and I can be with them at any time. It is a blessing I hold close to my heart every single day.</p><p data-start="2757" data-end="3185">This city of Bangalore feels like a gentle embrace. A new world. I feel anonymous, and that anonymity is strangely beautiful. There’s something liberating about walking into a café where no one knows your past, your scars, or your struggles. You’re just a woman with a smile and a story yet to unfold. The skies are kinder here, and the breeze seems to whisper: <strong><em data-start="3143" data-end="3185">Welcome, Shalini. This is your time now.</em></strong></p><p data-start="3187" data-end="3572">In this new city with a new job, I find a new rhythm of life. It feels surreal — almost like I’ve been handed a second life. A quieter one. A freer one. For the first time in decades, I wake up not to a list of duties, but to possibilities. I feel like I’m finally living for myself. No societal pressures. No burdens. No more “what will people say.” It’s just me, my dreams, and a new beginning.</p><p data-start="3574" data-end="3917">I walk with a spring in my step, take time to sip my green tea, and allow myself the space to learn, to breathe, to grow. I want to laugh more, read more, learn more. I want to take long walks under rain-soaked skies, lose myself in its bookstores, perhaps even join a poetry club, or finally publish that book I’ve always carried in my heart.</p><p data-start="3919" data-end="4304">Every day here feels like a breath of fresh air — the kind I didn’t know I was gasping for all these years. It feels like someone has hit ‘refresh’ on my life. This transition is a rebirth. I’ve stepped into a version of myself that had been quietly waiting behind the scenes — the woman who wants to explore weekend getaways, join a dance class, maybe go on solo trips. Who knows?</p><p data-start="4306" data-end="4556">So here’s to the woman I was — and the woman I’m becoming.<br data-start="4364" data-end="4367">To the tired feet that never stopped.<br data-start="4404" data-end="4407">To the silent tears and quiet prayers.<br data-start="4445" data-end="4448">To the nights of doubt and the mornings of determination.<br data-start="4505" data-end="4508">To second chances, soft mornings, and self-love.</p><p data-start="4558" data-end="4640"><strong data-start="4558" data-end="4582">Bangalore, thank you</strong> for welcoming this version of me — lighter, wiser, freer.</p><p data-start="4642" data-end="4932">Yes, language is a barrier — the flowing Kannada around me is unfamiliar — but I see it as a challenge, not a setback. I’ve promised myself that by next year, I will greet this city in its own tongue. Because this city has opened its arms to me — and I want to respond with love and effort.</p><p data-start="4934" data-end="5104">Because now, my life is not just about milestones, but moments.<br data-start="4997" data-end="5000">Not just about responsibilities, but rediscovery.<br data-start="5049" data-end="5052">Not just about giving, but also about receiving joy.</p><p data-start="5106" data-end="5213">If you ask me, <em data-start="5121" data-end="5137">“What’s next?”</em> — I’ll say with a smile, <em data-start="5163" data-end="5213">“I’m not sure. But I know it will be beautiful.”</em></p><p data-start="5215" data-end="5419">To every person who has spent years fulfilling duties and silencing dreams — let me remind you<strong>: It’s never too late to start again. You can move mountains with a determined heart.</strong><br data-start="5350" data-end="5353">Life doesn’t end at 50, or 60, or ever — not until <em data-start="5404" data-end="5409">you</em> let it.</p><p data-start="5421" data-end="5584">So here’s to Bangalore.<br data-start="5444" data-end="5447">To breaking the shackles.<br data-start="5472" data-end="5475">To finding freedom.<br data-start="5494" data-end="5497">To beginning again.<br data-start="5516" data-end="5519">To courage, to grace, and to the joy of becoming “you” once more.</p><p data-start="5586" data-end="5669"><strong data-start="5586" data-end="5617">Namaskara, Namma Bengaluru!</strong><br data-start="5617" data-end="5620">You have no idea how ready I am to call you home.</p><p data-start="5671" data-end="5797"><strong data-start="5671" data-end="5797">And to God — thank You for being so kind. Please keep guiding me, blessing me, and walking beside me — as You always have.</strong></p><hr data-start="5799" data-end="5802"><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div><div class="post__bio"><h3><a href="https://soigne68.github.io/authors/shalini-chaudhary/" title="Shalini Chaudhary">Shalini Chaudhary</a></h3></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://soigne68.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=babd20e2a0a25821e63a0529c9feaae0"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
